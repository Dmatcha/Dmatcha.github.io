  name: "Angelo Adair, The Distillery Baron", 
  description: 
    `Lead developer and engineer of soulgem distilleries; maniac. Empowers with soulgems. <br>\"I am the architect. Every step I take brings us closer to godhood.\"
    <br>Type: Tutorial FOE — Compulsory Encounter
<br>Role: Catalyst of the Player’s Existence
<br>Alignment: Hubristic Inventor / Mad Visionary
<br>Strength Tier: Low (Training FOE)
<br>Visual Inspiration: Dr. Eggman × Sephiroth × Steam-age aristocrat

<br><strong>Act I —</strong> The Dream and the Awakening
<br><i>Scene 1:</i> The Dreaming Tower 
<br>Players fall into a lucid, soothing dream.
They awaken within a tower under a massive full moon.
Books, candles, and a desk with fresh ink suggest someone was just here.
A locked door stands opposite a huge window.
On a round table, glass bubbles swirl with hazy contents.
Players may approach one bubble each.
<br>→ Upon touching, each bubble shatters.
<br>→ Fatigue overcomes them; the moon plummets into the tower.
<br>→ Darkness swallows all.

<br><i>Scene 2:</i> The Soul Distillery Aftermath
<br>Players awaken amid destruction—half-formed, bodies translucent and materializing. 
Corpses and coughing workers surround them. 
Sirens grow louder, painfully so. 
A colorful talking stone addresses them: “No time to explain! We gotta get outta here!” 
This marks the first decision fork. 

<br><strong>Act II —</strong> Escape or Remain
<br>Path A: Remain
<br>Players assist survivors for hours. Some survivors react with horror to the players’ strange bodies, others are thanful for their help. 
Sirens stop. Outside, soldiers close in. Capture is inevitable.

<br>Path B: Escape
<br>The stone cheers, urging them to flee. 
The players race to a train platform as night falls. 
They witness a man (Angelo Adair) surveying wreckage, giving orders to unmoving knights. 
He exudes authority, grief, and mania. 
<br>The stone whispers escape routes: West or East...

<br>West Path — The Great Bridge
<br>A Halfway House greets them with food and warmth. 
Festival atmosphere: it’s New Year’s Day, first of spring. 
[Calendar info hidden unless requested.] 
Players rest, then awaken amid celebration — and danger. 

Knights arrive. A captain with glass-and-feather crests identifies them: 
“There! Apprehend those anomalies!” 
“RUN!” yells the stone. 
They are inevitably captured and transported to Adair. 

<br>East Path — Jade Junction
<br>A sprawling industrial complex; bustling workers mistake players for temps. 
They labor briefly, gaining respite and information. 
Before long, patrols arrive and identify them — capture is inevitable here as well. 
<br><strong>Act III —</strong> The Distillation
<br>Captured, the heroes are brought before Angelo Adair himself: 
“My beautiful successes! My name is Angelo Adair! But you can call me god — your god!” 
He rants with unrestrained glee, claiming the players’ creation was his experiment— 
to redline an ancient Soul Distillery until human matter crystallized into sentient energy. 
“You are the proof! The culmination of my genius! With you, I’ll birth a radiant new age!” 
Players are restrained and loaded into glass tubes. 
Inside, rainbow sand (crystallized soul residue) begins to swirl. 
Adair paces, speaking cheerfully: 
“I love the song of compressors. Can you hear them sing?” 
(He cannot hear replies through the glass.) 
The process begins. A timer starts. 
The rock explains how to escape. 
Players can cooperate or struggle. 
Cooperation frees a player after 3 “throws.” 
Smashing the talking stone guarantees immediate breakout. 

<br>Failure to act before timer ends = player compression (turned into random soulgem). 

<strong>Act III Battle — </strong>“The Experiment Escapes”
<br>Opponents:
<br>FOE: Angelo Adair
<br>Knight Tokens I & II

<br>Setting: 
The core distillation chamber. 
Platforms, tubes, conduits, spinning turbines. 
Environmental hazards trigger every few turns (boiling steam, power surges). 

<br>Angelo’s Combat Style: 
Weaponizes unstable soulgem energy. 

Monologues constantly, even mid-battle. Random chance for his attacks to backfire (tutorial lesson). 
Can trigger “Overload” once, causing area damage and self-harm. 

<br>Defeat Dialogue: 
“Take this key… go forth, my creations… with every breath you take, I live on… forever… hahaha--…” 
He presses a hidden switch as he dies. 
Sirens sound: “ALERT. SELF-DECOMMISSION INITIATED.” 
Countdown begins — players must flee. 

<br><strong>Finale —</strong> The Great Escape
<br>As players flee the collapsing distillery: The talking stone guides them to safety along a rail path.

<br>From here, players can choose: Players must choose to burn down or destroy the advanced soulgem distillery (they escaped from in Act III) or flee the scene.  
If they burn it down, it damages the surrounding area and displace local populace, disrupt travel in through that area, and accidentally kill a few workers. This also affects relationships with NPCs later, as doing something insane like this is reprehensible.  
If they destroy the core with a few expertly-shot Arclight hits, the core explodes sending debris far and wide. A few workers are injured, but travel and other things remain intact. NPCs react positively to the story, and can solidify rebellious types. 
If the players flee, they get a headstart and are not pursued for a time. The advanced soulgem distillery remains a constant project being worked on, and the reconstruction efforts help to employ hundreds. Unfortunately, this means some FOEs may have access to powerful soulgems later. Players also evade suspicion more easily throughout the rest of the game. 

<br>South → The Jadian Ruins. 
<br>East → Heyn Megafarm and Station. 
<br>Double Back → Island of the Nowherefolk. 
<br>Get on a Ship → Travel to Orca, Serpente, or Dugong islands,
or continue west to Amethyst Porttown. 
<br>These options formally end the Tutorial Arc (Story 2)
and begin Story 3 (Free Exploration). 

<br><strong>FOE Outcomes Summary</strong>
<br>Player Action Consequence
<br>Burn down distillery    Large explosion; local devastation; workers killed. NPCs later condemn heroes.
<br>Destroy the core precisely  Controlled explosion; infrastructure intact; workers survive. NPCs respect heroes.
<br>Flee without destruction  Facility partially rebuilt; economy thrives; soulgem trade empowers future FOEs.
<br>Secret Lore (GM Eyes Only) 
(Angelo Adair worked under the Topazian Kingdoms as an alchemist. He was exiled after ethical violations involving live test subjects.) 
(He learned how to tune and amplify distillery technology from the Queen of Many Faces → implying she may possibly be a higher entity.) 
(His experiment that birthed the players was intended to create gems that never dust → but something unexpected: coincidence of resonance.) 
(The talking stone is a failed experiment: a soul partially crystallized but retaining self-awareness.)
{If players analyze the stone or resonate with it later, they may learn it was once Angelo’s assistant, who volunteered for the early test.} 
<br><br>After completing Angelo Adair’s FOE ARC, players are free to do “cycles” of the game.

  name: "Byron vey Byornn, The Commander", 
  description: 
    `Commander of mageknight legion. Famous family name. Paranoid, delusions of grandeur. Extreme strength, basic light sorcery. <br>\"We will have peace, order, justice in my lifetime. I'll raise that sun myself.\"
    (Epic tragic fantasy tone)
Byron was born into a role he could never fill. He was not gifted like his sister, but his pursuit of magicks drove him into madness. He ceased magicks to preserve what little sanity he had left, in order to maintain his leadership role. If it were not for the insane expectations he was born into, he would have been a sommelier, a poet, or a father.
(note: his mad visions are of our own world, as distillery tuning resonates, so does his mind, only in the opposite direction)
<strong>Act I —</strong> The Man Who Hears the Stars
Byron vey Byornn claims to hear voices from beyond — a chorus whispering from the radiant fields outside Halsefa’s skies. Upon first encounter, he invites the players to “join the Topazian Army.” He believes there is a force of evil rising on the continent and it will destroy all kingdoms. He says he has spies feeding him info, but really it is his dreams. 
> If players have any NPC, the NPC will refuse and leave party if they join Byron.
> If players have Flare, Flare will usurp the encounter. 
(despite anything, Byron does not know the identity of the players during the first encounter)
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Paranoia 
Byron is concerned the threatening force has already infected nearby towns and villages, and seeks to weed out traitors. In his paranoia, innocents will die. He learns players are mages (and possibly they are the coalesced) and offers them an immediate seat in the Royal Corps (even though we may learn he does not lead the Royal Corps, but is set to inherit it). Players can join or refuse. In either case, Byron plots to kill them. Players must escape at night and survive until dawn.
> If players have Flare, she defuses situation and aids their escape
(players can learn Byron has seen the sorcerer’s tower and the glass orbs, he ascended a spiral staircase to escape rising oceanwater, but before he could touch an orb, a figure appeared in the room and bellowed angrily, tendrils gripped his every limb and pulled him back through the door, he drowned spinning round and round back down the stairs and into darkness)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The False Heaven
Byron describes the visions, explains he thinks the Queen of Many Faces conspires to keep everyone on the continent, that there is another world out there with enough food for all, and no mages, no madness. That the continent is where mages have their power, her as well. He sees vehicles and bridges and restaurants and buildings like our modern day world. Byron opts to slay the players as they may act as a catalyst, allowing the Queen or others to connect to and invade other worlds. 
> If Flare is present, she laments the memories they shared together, and if only she were allowed to lead the corps.
> Every time Byron uses magic, he gains madness. After gaining enough, he dies regardless of health.
(Players can learn Byron is being empowered by a strange hybridized soulgem, fused into his chest)
Finale Decision
Mercy: Allow Flare to decide: she forgives him, but before she can reason with him he attempts to overload his soulgem with madness, releasing a deadly miasma in the area. Flare pierces right through him, destroy the gem and killing him. 
Slay: Kill Byron. Flare can never forget the ruthlessness you showed to her family, and it breaks something inside her.
Release: With a final blow, Byron is left concussed. He will later be apprehended for conspiracy to act against the Queen. He can later be found in the deep dungeons of Top.

  name: "Ceng Zhangyi, The Artifice Scholar", 
  description: 
    `Expert in mixed martial arts; researches artifacts and Jade Empire. Jade Empire supremacist. Uses basic artifacts. <br>\"Technology is our salvation. The answers, the truth of it all.\"
    <br><i>AKA "Junk Johnny"</i>
    (Dark mythic, techno-archaeological horror tone)
Ceng is motivated by racism, nationalism; despising his Topazian overlords, yearning to find a way to resurrect the Jade Empire and rule over all others. Tragedy is that stripped of his lust for power, you can see a scared, lonely boy, looking to finally feel safe; heart consumed by fear, hate, and revenge.
<strong>Act I —</strong> The Scavenger’s Smile
Ceng Zhangyi, called “Junk Johnny” by Topazian contractors, is an eccentric relic hunter with a laugh like breaking glass. He scours ruins for “arcane junk” — old world machines humming faintly with forbidden energy. When he encounters the players, his arcane trinket flares; it detects their latent ability to channel arcane magic. Enthralled, he invites them to join him in uncovering a buried library rumored to house a working Soul Distillery blueprint. His manner is charming yet predatory — every gesture just a bit too eager, every compliment edged with calculation. He insists that “the bones of gods sleep beneath Halsefa’s dirt.” No matter what, Ceng’s contractors hurry him up and shuffle off the players.
> Sympathetic to Anims, attempts kinship with Hitomi, Tsubasa, Jiu-Lin Fan.
> If Shang Tian is present, he sees through Ceng’s façade: Shang Explains he knows the eyes of one who looks down on others.
(can learn Ceng despises players, thinks of them as cockroaches, he can’t wait to crush their necks under his foot)
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Library of Hollow Eyes
Players may stumble into Ceng’s library. A guard attempts to escort the players away and strikes Ceng to get back to work. Ceng kills the guard, and explains his scheme to the players. He offers them to assist him in restoring the glory of the Jade empire and restore Jadians to their rightful place as the master race. He notes that the players would likely die during the wars that follow, but if they survive they may remain to help spice up the Jadian gene pool. If players fight or flee, Ceng calls for reinforcements and blames the death of the guard on the players.
> Tress, Guy, Shang, Dante, Marco will note to players he killed the man with raw martial arts, but he has something deadlier hidden in his pocket, some kind of arcane weapon.
> If players want to join, he uses his hidden weapon which disintegrates one player immediately. Allies flee.
(players can learn about the nature of his hidden weapon, and that he has already found the experimental Arcane Distillery, along with old Jadian Tech hidden beneath the library)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The Sleeping Dragons
The players descend into the depths and enter the old Arcane Distillery beneath the library. They hear Ceng’s voice echo from devices mounted in the corners of every room, Ceng proclaims that he has “awakened the will of the Jadians.” His relics hum to life, and players must fight their way through the awakened machinations. Ceng is trying to fully power a giant machine, having some gauntlet and greave attached to him with wires running into the mech. Ceng reduces magickal and physical attacks. As time goes on, their power is being drained and funneled into the giant machine. 
> Players learn to shatter the trinket that links him to the arcane machines — the very device that first detected them. 
> Any ally will volunteer to get close to him and disconnect the trinket/sabotage him powering up the robot.
As he dies, Johnny whispers, “Glory to the Jade Empire, the best of mankind.”
(Players can learn Johnny has an accomplice, someone was funding him and helping him, with similar aims)
Finale Decision
Destroy the Library: Prevent others from continuing his work, but erase valuable knowledge about ancient arcane systems.
Seal the Arcane Distillery: Hide its existence and leave it for future explorers, risking rediscovery by darker hands.
Reclaim the Knowledge: Take Johnny’s notes and blueprint — unlocking forbidden upgrades later, but inviting the ghosts of the Jadians to haunt the players’ dreams.

  name: "Daisuke Daioh, The Artificer", 
  description: 
    `Seasoned veteran of anti-rebellion battles; protects the status-quo. Elitism; royal supremacist. Uses gemstone powered artifacts. <br>\"Find something that makes you powerful and stick to it.\"
    (Cinematic war tragedy; allegory for the military-industrial machine)
Raised in a cruel world, Daisuke saw the powerful -Mages- and the powerless. He could not explain the disparity, the cruelty. He could either admit the injustice and fight to overthrow it (and die in the process, having achieved nothing) or justify it as God’s Will. He saw that the more her submitted to God’s Authority, the more power he was granted (politically) and eventually that led him to being granted soulgems to gain his own power to be on-par with mages. He saw this as God’s Way for him.
<strong>Act I —</strong> The Cleansing Fire
Players arrive in a settlement swallowed by smoke and gunmetal light. The air reeks of burning grain and blood. Daisuke Daioh, emerges from the fray, clad in bloodied armor, he beckons for overseers of the purge like a conductor guiding a symphony. He speaks of “strategic cleansing” — the killing of rebels, livestock, and irrigation lines as “preventative maintenance.” His voice is calm, fatherly even, as he insists this is necessary to maintain order — a reflection of heaven’s own order. Those who disobey are not just criminals but heretics against the natural, god-bestowed chain of command. When players intervene, he treats them as wayward children defying the will of the gods. He does not attack the players, but instead justifies his actions in the name of god and queen. He dismisses them to be on their way.
(players can learn he is regretful that a few of the children showed magical talent, as they will be sent to the academies instead of joining their friends and families in death)
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Law of the Sword
The players discover they have been branded fugitives. Bulletins with their descriptions across towns — signed by Daisuke himself. His army pursues them between cullings, framing them for sabotage and massacres that he himself engineered. Captured rebels whisper that Daisuke creates enemies to justify his continued funding and divine mandate. When confronted, he admits it without shame: “The gods demand struggle. The crown must prove its strength, or the world forgets its place.” He offers the players amnesty if they kneel, urging them to “serve the rightful order”.
> If Hitomi, Tsubasa, Hector are present: challenge his god belief.
> If Tress, Evelynn, Lumiere: Prepare a distraction to help convince Daisuke players are already captured.
(can learn of his becoming infected with moonworms, and may be forced to retire, growing desperate to keep power)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The Trap of Honor
Daisuke invites the players under a banner of truce to a parley. It’s an ambush. Inside, they find civilians chained beside war machines, their deaths staged to look like a rebel atrocity. The entire fortress is wired to explode — a false-flag event meant to rally faith in the Queen. Called a coward and a monster by a captured mageling, Daisuke bashes their head until they stop moving. He challenges anyone else to test his honor given from god. Players can challenge him to combat -solo- and then other players may free themselves to join the fight.
(can learn he is actually weakened due to the moonworms and smoking cloudberry until he can get his hands on some actual fresh dawnsmoke leaves to cure him)
Finale Decision
Kill Him: End his reign. Towns and villages more wealthy, less likely to report players, more distrusting of the kingdom.
Expose Him: Deliver evidence to authorities; after a public trial and execution, replaced with night raids/assassins.

    `Founder and financier of sorcery academies; human trafficker. Retired sorceress. Well-connected. May use advanced magicks. <br>\"Ha! My time is worth more than yours, I guarantee it; pay up or get out.\"
    (High society intrigue; mythic capitalist horror)
She lived among royal families and became part of the capitalist machine. Everyone must be made useful to her, or else they must be removed. She saw that money, gold is the ultimate power. She coordinated the founding and recruitment process of academies, in addition to kidnappings and human trafficking. She sees all life as valuable, literally. She sees nothing wrong with what she does, especially because she is very good at it. If it was wrong, people wouldn’t “let” her.
<strong>Act I —</strong> The Lady of Information
The players first hear Elizabeth Einsborough’s name in taverns and news sheets — The Ledger. Her reach extends far and wide. When players rescue magelings or interfere with human trafficking, they receive a message: Elizabeth requests a “civil discussion.” Her offer: return the “misappropriated assets” or pay damages to her consortium. She presents herself as entirely reasonable, speaking from experience. If players refuse to pay, the messenger presents a second offer from her: Elizabeth will pay them instead.
> Most allies will comment that the group is fucked for crossing her, regardless of what they do.
> Dante will offer his detective skills to find her before she sends henchmen; Jon offers his services as he has slept with her before. 
(If players do either, she makes use of coin-sniffing pigs that track down the players for her assassins.)
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Network of Strings
The players’ actions ripple across the media. Reports twist their deeds into heresy or terrorism. Elizabeth manipulates the flow of truth itself — inns, taverns, merchants of all kinds are wary to deal with the players. Eventually players receive yet another message: Elizabeth has decided to starve our players of everything until they die, or kill one another until one remains. Her spies are watching, trailing them, pre-empting their every move.
> Dante will offer his detective skills to find her before she sends henchmen; Jon offers his services as he has slept with her before.
(players can try to trap one of the spies, or interrogate someone for info)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The Palace of Papers
The final confrontation takes place in her towering office overlooking the city of Top —  hiding in plain sight. She invites the players to negotiate as they are on the cusp of becoming pariahs. Elizabeth offers them a deal: disappear from history, and she will make them legends in fiction. If players choose to negotiate, treat the negotiation like combat encounter. If players fight, Elizabeth isn’t very mobile due to her age, but is capable of powerful spells. The close-quarters of her office mean combat is very fast and deadly.
> Dante blinds her momentarily, refusing to kill humans; Jon offers his services, and Elizabeth relents.
(can learn despite her connections, is looking for what happened to her son and partner)
Finale Decision
Kill Her: Players remain infamous for days, but as her lies are not being spread and their names are not being poisoned, their reputation slowly returns and they are able to engage normally.
Buy Her Out: Pay or barter; players’ reputations are restored and they are able to engage freely again.
Publicize Her Crimes: Turn her own network against her; she vanishes, leaving a power vacuum to be filled directly by the Queen’s appointee.

    (Dark mythic tone; seductive horror and madness embodiment)
Talented since she learned to walk, family sold her rights early to an academy. Was abducted by rival academy, who were then ambushed by another academy cell. After bloodshed, Fal is left to wander into the darkwood at night, and becomes infected with moonworms. Spirits and critters care for her, fending off wormridden creatures from taking her to join their hive while her body fights the infection. Eventually, a purple-skinned half-anim finds her, guided by the wildlife. Fal smokes dawnsmoke until her body is cleansed, but the effects alter her mental state. Fal is raised in the darkwood, and trained to be a guardian: protecting the peace of the people and wildlife that live there, tucked away from the strife of the outside world.
<strong>Act I —</strong> A Tongue Twisting Deep In Your Ear
When a player gains a madness effect, Fal awakens — a shadow-born sorceress who slips between dreams. She speaks through mirrors or the edges of campfires, whispering “I can quiet the screaming stars.” Her interest lies not in the players’ power but in their corruption. She stalks their subconscious, preying on guilt, lust, and despair. Her presence is intimate and haunting; nightmares begin to cause real wounds. The afflicted awaken with trembling hands, their stamina drained.
> Hitomi, Evelynn, Guy, Anjali and Naya can comment on what is happening.
<strong>Act II —</strong> A Foot Forced Firmly In The Face
The players learn Fal is the guardian to the Darkwood, a dreamwalker and protector of nowherefolk. When the soulgem distilleries began harvesting dreams as fuel, the wards around the darkwood fractured. Now, she fuels the wards via the madness of others: she does not take away the madness, she merely connects a ward to it. She begins to haunt the player with the highest madness level, whispering offers of power, or even love: “Let me keep your mind safe. Give me the pain.” A cursed bond may form; players may even bed her, sealing a pact that festers in their soul.
> Million, Anjali, Marco, and Naya can lead you to Fal directly, beginning Act III whenever the players wish.
<strong>Act III —</strong> Deep In The Darkwood
Upon entering the deepest part of the Darkwood, players meet Fal swinging in a hammock. She commands them to leave, as their role as wards is pointless if they are inside the Darkwood. She demands the players either help her reclaim the Darkwood (destroying distilleries that harvest dreams) or perish. As this request is insane and would take years, players protest. Fal sighs and descends from her hammock, sleepily like a graceful drunk. She explains: Killing her risks spreading her essence like spores into their minds, as she has tried to turn each of them into wards. Destroying her wards would allow people to find and enter the Darkwood freely, and it would be robbed of resources. {players can instead swoon and seduce Fal, agreeing to funnel madness to her: at Camps, a random player may dream of Fal and remove madness, if they cannot, Fal causes harm to the player}
(players can learn that cloudberry bushes and dawnsmoke plants grow plentifully here, among other natural wonders)
Finale Decision
Destroy Her: End the nightmare; her essence infuses the party’s dreams forever.
Leave Her: She becomes a random recurring nightmare when she needs madness.
Love Her: Make an open pact — she joins their dreams, consuming their madness to fuel her wards over Darkwood.

    (Cinematic noir-meets-political thriller tone)
Born by the docks, raised in the busy street markets. If he wasn’t stealing, he was wheeling. If he wasn’t wheeling, he was dealing. Runs the “Cloudcatchers,” a network distributing the addictive edible derived from a rare flower. Charismatic and ruthless, he’s a businessman first, a criminal second. Talent for finding anyone’s vice. Is solely responsible for the rise of the cloudberry industry. Smuggles dawnsmoke to common folk, as he’s seen too much the devastation wrought by such a curable condition. Actively fights to maintain order among his network of trade, and avoids dealings with soulgems.
<strong>Act I —</strong> The Pollen 
One of the players must be infected with moonworms, otherwise the player at dusk becomes infected with moonworms. The players need to ask around about moonworm infection symptoms and rememdies; then source dawnsmoke, and must track down a supplier, before the moonworm infection progresses. Eventually, they will encounter some dealer, and procure old-leaf to smoke, which eases the pain and delays some of the infection, but is not strong enough to cure the player.
> Jon, Anjali, Naya, Jiu-lin avoid the search and can bring players directly to a source for dawnsmoke.
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Bloom
As the infection progresses, players grow desperate. In pursuit of fresher leaves, they learn about the rat king himself. The city whispers his name like a brand; the royals quietly fund him to maintain control of the working class. They cross paths with him when seeking a cure for infection. He offers them a taste of dawnsmoke: an outdated, diluted strain that soothes symptoms but never heals, much like the dawnsmoke from before. He knows they are mages, and should be contracted by an academy, so they should have enough money to pay. Gary predicts in a few moon’s time, the infected player will be fully controlled by the worms, but should the players gather enough funds, he will supply fresh dawnsmoke for a cure.
> Chinara, Lumiere, Evelynn offer to fund portions of your payment, reducing the price.
(can learn he has no supply of fresh dawnsmoke, and must procure it elsewhere)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The Wheel
As the players dig deeper, they learn that he is researching more potent strains of cloudberries, which can mask the effects of moonworm infections, keeping people infected instead of curing them like dawnsmoke. They are cultivated secretly in royal gardens alongside private stocks of dawnsmoke. Gary profits from both sides, while also financing the OCU to ensure his empire has a spot there too. When confronted, he justifies his actions: “Everyone needs their medicine. Be a shame if it were free.” Due to the player’s knowledge, he doubles the agreed price. But how are players to be guaranteed they’ll be cured this time? Players can negotiate or fight him.

Finale Decision
Kill Him: End the distribution; infections rip through the slums and markets, royals monopolize the cure.
Deal with Him: Agree to find other fertile ground for dawnsmoke; move freely in cities no matter notoriety.
Expose Him: Spark riots in the slums; increased knights presence in cities. Dawnsmoke and loudberry prices skyrocket as supply evaporates.

    `Expert improviser; legendary killer. Moves instantly when unseen. Knows when to withdraw. May evade any attack; counterattack. <br>\"Nothing personal. Hush.\"
    (Cinematic Fantasy / Melancholic Assassin Tragedy)

<strong>Act I —</strong> The Whisper
After the players have slain several FOEs, strange symbols appear on objects along their path (trees/rocks/walls etc.) and they glow when touched or approached. *Players can notice footprints around their campfire, faint melody in the dark, the smell of strange perfume. A silent nemesis stalks them. She strikes when they are weakest — often mid-rest. When confronted, she speaks playfully, even apologetically. She is not cruel, only tired — her eyes betray years of killing, having long since grown bored of the act. During combat, Hyunjin becomes more excited every turn. Prior to any lethal blow, Hyujin throws a smoke bomb with a slight paralytic effect, and flees. 
> Million, Shang, and The Courier have special dialogue, causing Hyunjin to gain slow.
(Hyunjin can feel being perceived and throws knives/blades at perceiver)
<strong>Act II —</strong> The Chain
During the next dawn, or at certain camps, one player is taken hostage. Remaining players have one chance to intervene, or the hostage is killed instantly. Combat encounter afterward. Hyunjin explains she’s taken an interest in learning who the players are, as few survive encountering her. She explains she discovered she had a knack for killing, then so did the kingdom. After her hundredth kill, she realized she’d never be free. The day she refused, hesitated, got too old, they’d kill her too. She could run for a while, but “even monkeys fall from trees” she says.
(players can learn she hasn’t been using the seals anymore, and instead using disguises)
<strong>Act III —</strong> The Lament
The final encounter takes place at night, or dusk. Hyunjin always strikes first. 
> Million, Jon Quixote, and Marco have special interactions, intervening in a killing blow to a player.
(having failed twice, can learn Hyunjin fears the kingdom will dispose of her soon)
<strong>Finale —</strong> The Number
If the players show mercy, she fires a flare. Turning to the players, she laughs and throws up her fingers: nine, eight, six. Wounded, she disappears into the night. She will later aid in assassinating some of the royals and Knights III when encountered, buying herself more time to stay alive.
Kill: With her dying breaths, she reveals a tally etched into her armguard: nine-hundred eighty-six. She ignites a flare stick, alerting her masters of her failure.
*Contract: The Courier, Evelynn, Chinara may offer to employ Hyunjin instead.
Note: post-defeat, bards will sing that the cursed songbird sings no more; Hyunjin had a beautiful singing voice, and would sing about her regrets and life she wished she’d lived.
